## Findings
- Based on the analysis, I can recommend trying to kickstart your kickstarter play campaign near the months of May and June, and aim to get your play produced for less than the mean of around 4,000.

I hope this data analysis helps you on your way to producing your very own play and I will be the first one to buy tickets to come see it!
